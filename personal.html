                <h1>Experience</h1>
                <p>I am an emerging front-end developer with foundational skills in Angular and TypeScript,
                     striving to advance my proficiency in these frameworks. My current level of expertise is moderate;
                      I possess a working knowledge that enables me to contribute to projects but leaves ample room for 
                      growth and deeper mastery. Despite being relatively new to the field, I have cultivated strong 
                      competencies in JavaScript and HTML/CSS, which are fundamental to front-end development.
                    </p>  <p>
                    Throughout my learning journey, I have engaged in various projects
                     that have honed my skills in creating responsive, user-friendly interfaces.
                      My understanding of JavaScript is particularly robust, allowing me to implement
                       dynamic and interactive features effectively. Similarly, my command of HTML and 
                       CSS is solid, enabling me to craft well-structured, aesthetically pleasing web pages 
                       that adhere to contemporary web standards.
                    </p><p>
                    I am committed to continuous learning and am actively seeking opportunities to expand
                     my technical repertoire and practical experience. My goal is to refine my Angular and
                      TypeScript abilities to an advanced level, thereby enhancing my capability to deliver 
                      high-quality, scalable web applications. I am eager to contribute to a forward-thinking
                       team where I can leverage my current skills
                     while embracing new challenges that drive my professional growth.</p>
